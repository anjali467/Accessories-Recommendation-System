# Accessories Recomendation System


I have tried to build a system where user have to uplaod their images with dress and a sytem will fetch the suitable accessories macthing with the dress and provide four set of different categories like Earring, Bracelet, goggles, necklace and purse as a solution. This technology has been built by using machine learning methodologies to came up with the solution for Aeisthetic Fashion. This system is basically a training model. The suggested accessories are applied on the User uploaded photo for validation either its perfect match for the dress or not.

## Technologies Used: 

[ResNet50](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/ResNet50)

[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

[Mediapipe](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe)

[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

[Keras](https://keras.io/)

[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html)





## Five Categories of Data

 - Necklace
 - Earring
 - Bracelet
 - Goggles
 - Purse
 


## Working Techniques-
The feature is extracted from the user uplaoded image and then those features are match with the data collection and suitable matches are provided as a solution
